		&Aring;re Skiweek is a skiing event particularly for students. Sportsektionen has a tradition of arranging an annual trip to &Aring;re during &Aring;re Skiweek, and this year is no exception. &Aring;re is not only a great skiing location but also has a nightlife which no other skiing region can match.
		</p>
		<p>
This year we have signed up for 20 persons, where living accommodations most likely will be split into four or five apartments in central &Aring;re. We will not be able to register for additional spots once our 20 are gone, so be sure to sign up as soon as possible!
</p>
		<strong>Date:</strong> 17<sup>th</sup> of January to 21<sup>st</sup> of January, 2016.
		<strong>Price*:</strong> 2045 SEK. Will be paid no later than November.
		This includes among other things
		<ul>
			<li>Re-booking insurance</li>
			<li>Ski pass (five days)</li>
			<li>Lodging in apartment in central &Aring;re (four nights)</li>
			<li>20% discount on ski rental at SkiStarshop</li>
		</ul>
