	\section{Documents}
	At the start of this year all we had was First Class containing documents from several years back and a link to a Dropbox account to which we had no write access. Since it was decided by DSV that the First Class platform would be shut down during 2015 we had to backup all the files in First Class and migrate to a new platform. We found that the most suitable replacment for the sole puropse of handling files and documents as protocols, reports, statutes, posters and etc. was GitHub which uses version management with the Git protocol. This provides backup since it's hosted by GitHub and provides the transparency we want for our members.

	Some documents of more private or delicate nature, like contracts or data from registration forms which contains personal information is hosted on Google Drive in a shared folder. The ambition is however that as much as possible should be shared and open for the benefit of transparency.
